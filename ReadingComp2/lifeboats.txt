Lifeboats
At 2:20 AM on April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank into the icy depths of the northern Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg. Because the ship did not carry enough lifeboats only 700 passengers were saved. The other 1,500 people on board were killed. Due to this catastrophe on the world's most luxurious ship, the first International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea was held the following year. It was decided that any sailing ship was required to carry enough lifeboats for the entire crew and passenger complement.
